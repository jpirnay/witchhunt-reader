# Testing and Debugging

CrossPoint runs on real hardware, so debugging usually combines local build checks, host-side tests and on-device logs.

## Local checks

Make sure `clang-format` 21+ is installed and available in `PATH` before running the formatting step.
If needed, see [Getting Started](./getting-started.md).

```sh
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check --fail-on-defect low --fail-on-defect medium --fail-on-defect high
pio run
```

## Host tests

Parsing, layout, cache and most non-UI code is covered by GoogleTest suites in `test/`, built with CMake and run on the development machine. CI runs them on every push and pull request (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the host test job):

```sh
cmake -S test -B build/test -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/test
ctest --test-dir build/test --output-on-failure -j
```

Any build directory works; `test/build` is a common local choice, and every `build*/` directory is git-ignored. To iterate from inside one:

```sh
cd test/build
cmake --build . -j 8
ctest -j 8 --output-on-failure
ctest -R EpubPipeline          # one suite by name
cmake --build . --target LibraryIndexTest && ./library_index/LibraryIndexTest   # build and run one executable
```

A suite lives in its own directory under `test/` and is registered by an `add_subdirectory()` line in `test/CMakeLists.txt`; a new suite needs both. GoogleTest is fetched on the first configure. `test/README` has the offline KOReader sync checks, which the host toolchain cannot build.

**On Windows**, build and run from Git Bash with the MSYS2 UCRT64 toolchain (`C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`) on `PATH`, not from PowerShell: the compiler there depends on DLLs from that directory and fails silently without them. The test executables link their C++ runtime statically, so they run whatever else is on `PATH`. One tool does not build on Windows: `epub_build_inventory` needs `dlfcn.h` and `execinfo.h`. Pass `-k 0` to Ninja so the rest of the suite builds anyway:

```sh
cmake --build . -j 8 -- -k 0
```

**Golden files.** `EpubPipelineTest` compares a layout dump of every book in `test/epubs` against `test/epub_pipeline/goldens`. When a change is meant to move layout, regenerate them and say why in the commit:

```sh
UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 ctest -R EpubPipeline
```

When a change should move layout but not content, compare word streams rather than whole goldens: take the `t=` field of every `W x=… s=… z=… t=…` record in the dump, in order, before and after the change. Redirect stderr to a separate file first; an interleaved `BENCHMARK` line can split a record. The dump covers table cells too, in row order, so the word stream stays the same when a table switches between grid and paragraph layout. It does not cover anchors; `AnchorMapTest` and `AnchorPageAccuracyTest` do.

`HeapPeakRegression` guards the heap peak of a section build; see the next section.

## Measuring memory

[Memory Allocation Strategy §7](../memory-allocation-strategy.md#7-measuring-memory) explains what each tool and log line measures. To reproduce a measurement:

**On the host**, from the repository root, with `B` set to your host build directory:

```sh
B=build/test
WH_HOST_STDIO_UNBUFFERED=1 $B/epub_pipeline/epub_pipeline_dump book.epub /tmp/cache-a --bench > dump.txt 2> bench.txt
WH_HOST_STDIO_UNBUFFERED=1 $B/epub_pipeline/epub_pipeline_dump book.epub /tmp/cache-b --bench --arena=52272 > dump.txt 2> bench.txt
```

The first run models a build with nothing lent, the second a build in the X3's borrowed framebuffer (use 48000 for the X4). Use an empty cache directory for a cold build. `bench.txt` has the per-spine times, `heap_peak`, the allocation size histogram and the largest allocation sites. `test/epub_pipeline/run_baseline.sh $B/epub_pipeline/epub_pipeline_dump` tabulates time and peak heap over the whole corpus. `epub_pipeline_dump_noheap` is the same tool without the heap tracker, for when only the layout dump is needed.

`ctest -R HeapPeakRegression` checks six fixtures in both modes against `test/epub_pipeline/heap_peak_baseline.txt`. When a change lowers or raises a peak on purpose, re-baseline and explain it in the commit:

```sh
UPDATE_HEAP_BASELINE=1 ctest --test-dir $B -R HeapPeakRegression
```

For a site-by-site inventory of one build (Linux only):

```sh
$B/epub_pipeline/epub_build_inventory book.epub /tmp/cache-c /tmp/inventory --arena=52272 --spines=3
python3 test/epub_pipeline/inventory_report.py $B/epub_pipeline/epub_build_inventory /tmp/inventory/spine_3.txt > report.md
```

**On a device**, flash `env:default` and read the `[MEM]`, `Reader mem[...]`, `FBUF` and `createSectionFile ... arena:` lines from the serial log. For a deeper trace, define a local env in `platformio.local.ini`, which is git-ignored and loaded through `extra_configs`. Name the build in `CROSSPOINT_VERSION`, which the boot log echoes; `scripts/git_branch.py` supplies it only for `env:default` and the `*_gh_release_rc` envs, so any other env sets it itself:

```ini
[env:memtrace]
extends = base, firmware_tuned
build_flags =
  ${c3.build_flags}
  -DCROSSPOINT_VERSION=\"${crosspoint.version}-memtrace\"
  -DENABLE_SERIAL_LOG
  -DLOG_LEVEL=2
  -DSCT_HEAP_TRACE=1
```

Then `pio run -e memtrace --target upload`. `SCT_HEAP_TRACE=1` adds a heap and arena line per page of every section build, `HEAP_GATE_TRACE=1` makes every reader heap gate print its arithmetic, and `EHP_FORCE_BLOCKING_BUILD` pins every section to the blocking build so two runs take the same path. To compare two firmware variants, clear the book's cache before each run and compare changes across one step of a run rather than end-to-end values: the heap a run starts from varies more than many effects being measured.

## Flash and monitor

Flash firmware:

```sh
pio run --target upload
```

To write an image that is already built without PlatformIO re-scanning the project first, use `bin/flash` (bash, including Git Bash) or `bin\flash.ps1` (PowerShell). Both call esptool on `.pio/build/<env>/` directly, warn when sources are newer than the image, and keep retrying until the device appears, so you can start the script and then wake the device:

```sh
./bin/flash                     # env "default"
./bin/flash -e x4pro -p COM6    # another env, a named port (or set FLASH_PORT)
./bin/flash -a                  # app image only; bootloader and partition table untouched
./bin/flash -f saved.bin        # flash this app image instead of the env's firmware.bin
./bin/flash -n                  # print the esptool command and exit
```

With `-f`, the bootloader and partition table still come from the env's build directory; if it has none, the script writes the app alone and says so. `-w SECONDS` sets how long it waits for the device (0 fails at once). Like a PlatformIO upload, the scripts leave the NVS partition, and with it the settings, alone.

Open serial monitor:

```sh
pio device monitor
```

Optional enhanced monitor:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py
```

## Test release workflows locally with `act`

Use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) to dry-run the release workflows
after modifying them. Running locally with `act` is faster and more iterative
than pushing commits to GitHub and waiting for Actions to run. It will test the
entire workflow, including job conditions and release-notes generation, without
actually publishing releases or uploading assets.

For this repository, local `act` runs simulate different GitHub event types for
the two release workflows:

- `release.yml` is exercised with a simulated `release` event whose action is
  `published`
- `release_candidate.yml` is exercised with a simulated `push` event on
  a `release/**` branch

### What local `act` runs validate

Local runs are useful for validating:

- workflow wiring and job conditions
- PlatformIO release builds
- release-notes generation via `scripts/generate_release_notes.py` (`release_candidate.yml`)

Local `act` runs do **not** publish GitHub releases or upload release assets.
Those steps are skipped when `ACT=true`, so final release publication still
requires a real GitHub Actions run.

### Prerequisites

- `act` installed locally
- Docker available and running
  - Podman will most likely also work. Ensure the rootless user socket is
    configured and set `DOCKER_HOST` to its path (e.g.
    `export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`).
- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- event payload files in `.github/act/`

Included payload files:

- `.github/act/release-published.json` to simulate the `release.published` event
  used by `release.yml`
- `.github/act/release-candidate-push.json` to simulate the branch-push event
  used by `release_candidate.yml`

### Provide `GITHUB_TOKEN` safely

Release-notes generation expects `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Prefer exporting it from `gh`
instead of pasting a token directly into shell history:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"
```

Then pass it to `act` by name:

```sh
act ... -s GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Unset it when finished:

```sh
unset GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### Run the stable release workflow locally

```sh
act release \
  -W .github/workflows/release.yml \
  -e .github/act/release-published.json \
  -s GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### Run the release-candidate workflow locally

```sh
act push \
  -W .github/workflows/release_candidate.yml \
  -e .github/act/release-candidate-push.json \
  -s GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### What still needs a real GitHub run

After a local `act` pass, a real GitHub Actions run is still required to verify:

- GitHub release creation
- asset upload
- workflow permissions and repository-token behavior
- the exact GitHub-hosted runner environment
