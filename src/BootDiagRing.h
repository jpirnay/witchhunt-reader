/// The pure half of the boot/sleep diagnostics: the on-card record format, the ring layout
/// that holds it, and the rules for reading a record back.
///
/// Split out from BootDiagnostics so it can be exercised on the host. Every defect this
/// feature has shipped so far has been in exactly this logic and every one of them was
/// found by flashing a device: a stage read as a verdict before it was final, a reset
/// reason trusted to mean something the C3 cannot express, and a newest-first scan that
/// broke on its own record. None of that needs hardware to catch — it needs a test — and
/// none of it needs Arduino, the HAL, NVS or an SD card to express, so this header depends
/// on nothing but <cstdint> and <cstring>.

/// Everything here operates on a caller-supplied byte image; file I/O, RTC memory and NVS
/// stay in BootDiagnostics.cpp.
