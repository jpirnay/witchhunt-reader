// Where the four bottom button hints actually landed, so a tap can be matched against the
// strip that is really on screen.
//
// Split from ButtonHintLayout.h, which decides where the boxes GO and needs BoardConfig
// (and therefore Arduino.h) to do it. This half only records where they WENT, and its
// consumers are the input side, which has no business depending on board geometry. Keeping
// it free-standing also makes the hit test host-testable -- the arithmetic is the part most
// likely to be wrong and the part hardest to check on a device.
//
// Coordinates are PORTRAIT logical px: both drawButtonHints() implementations force Portrait
// for the duration of the draw and restore afterwards, so that is the frame these numbers are
// in, whatever the screen is rotated to. A hit test must therefore resolve its tap into the
// Portrait frame as well -- GfxRenderer::tapToLogical(Orientation, ...) exists for exactly
// that -- rather than against the live orientation. Doing so makes the strip tappable in all
// four orientations; matching against live coords would only work while the screen is
// portrait, and would silently hit the wrong box otherwise.
//
// Index i is raw hardware button i. mapLabels() emits the four labels in
// {BTN_BACK, BTN_CONFIRM, BTN_LEFT, BTN_RIGHT} order and permutes only the text, so a hit
// needs no further mapping and honours the user's button remapping for free.

// this tick" and the tap falls through to whoever else wants it, which is the safe way to
