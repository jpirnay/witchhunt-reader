// Ported from crosspoint-reader PR #2734 ("feat: Add browser-side plugin system
// with SD card support", Justin Mitchell / @itsthisjustin), whose design this
// follows closely: the three SD roots, earliest-root-wins collision handling,
// and the marker-file classification are all his. Reduced here to the browser
// plugin surface only - none of that branch's device-capability endpoints,
// on-device catalog or content-protection work is carried over - and bounded
// with a per-root directory cap.
//
// Where web-UI plugins live on the SD card. A plugin is just a folder holding a
// plugin.js (and optionally a manifest.json); the web server discovers it and
// the browser loads it, so adding one needs no firmware build.
//
// /.crosspoint/plugins is the canonical home. /plugins and /.plugins are also
// scanned because a dot-prefixed folder is awkward to create on some desktop
// file managers, and copying a folder onto the card should be all it takes.

// two SD stats to classify, and the scan runs inside a single request, so an
// unbounded loop over a folder that happens to hold hundreds of subdirectories

// Scans every root. The earliest root holding a folder name claims it - matching
